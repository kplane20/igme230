    <h2>Assets</h2>
    <p>All Image Assests were my own</p>
     <p>The mocks used are from free mockup world https://www.mockupworld.co/all-mockups/ where I have the rights to go in and add my work to make it my own</p>
    
       <p>The font is Oswald and Open Sans, and both can be found at Google Fonts </p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>Much of my challenges were style changes, in terms of HTML I was able to get most everything to work </p>
        <p>At first I struggled to get my grid to work however once I was able to do so I was really happy with how it came out since I have always wanted to create a website that looked like this</p>
        <p>The struggle to get the text decoration to go away is a constant struggle that never seems to work for me no matter how many times I have tried searching or playing with it</p>
        <p>I improved my resume by changing the viewport width which was a challenge to figure out what the viewport width should truly be</p>
        <p>Making sure all my content was able to look good and be repoonsive so creating the proper media queries is always a challenge for me but it always worked out in the end</p>
         <p>At one point I struggled with the correct columns and rows and understanding when to implement them and how to adjust and change their sizing</p>
          <p>Finally, I could not get the menu on the about me page to work</p>

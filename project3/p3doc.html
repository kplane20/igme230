    <h2>Assets</h2>
    <p>All Image Assests were my own</p>
     <p>The mocks used are from free mockup world https://www.mockupworld.co/all-mockups/ where I have the rights to go in and add my work to make it my own</p>
    
       <p>The font is Oswald, from Google Fonts </p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>Much of my challenges were style changes, in terms of HTML I was able to get most everything to work </p>
        <p>My biggest challenge was getting responsiveness to work the way I wanted, there was some adjustmenst that had to be made that I feel may have impacted the overall design of certain elements such as the about me page.</p>
        <p>Adding a drop down into my design was also a last minute factor to implement. I decided to do so on my contact page because when I tried to add it to my resume page, any edit I made did not seem to matter. The dropdown menu would only remain in the middle of the page. Because of this, I have a Resume dropdown on my page that gives the user two options: save the resume, or share it. </p>
        <p>I did so by linking the share to gmail link and the save option allows the user to view and download my resume. The other challenge associated with this is that the "Button" associated with the save is not directly on top of the save button</p>
        <p>Another challenge I faced was linking my name to the home page. I was able to link it properly however when it came to styling it, I could not get the text decoration to go away. I applied in multiple different areas however the underline did not seem to disappear</p>
